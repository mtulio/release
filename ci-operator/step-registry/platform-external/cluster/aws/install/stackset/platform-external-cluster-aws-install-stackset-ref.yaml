    UPI steps to deploy AWS resources required to install OpenShift cluster using Platform External.
    The UPI steps are based in the AWS CloudFormation templates provided by installer repo (upi).
    Note 1: long-term goal is to create a generic step to be reused on regular UPI flow, preventing
    openshift-install's commands on platform-specific step.
